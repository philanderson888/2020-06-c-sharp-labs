# Scratchpad Revision

## Agile

General way of building code where developers work together and build in 'increments' starting off with the most simple (MVP Minimum Viable Product) and gradually becoming more complex

Adapt to customer demand

Values working code over documentation



## Scrum

Particular IMPLEMENTATION OF AGILE where you work in SPRINTS and have 4 meetings per sprint a) Plan b) Daily Standup c) Review (customer) d) Retrospective (internal improvement for next time)

ADVANTAGE IS THAT DURING THE SPRINT WE LOCK BACKLOG/REQUIREMENTS FOR THAT SPRINT SO THAT THE DEVELOPERS CAN FOCUS ON JUST THE WORK
